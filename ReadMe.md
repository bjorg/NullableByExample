# Nullable by Example

## Getting Started

1. Enable nullable types for the entire project by adding the `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` element to your `.csproj` files.
1. Add the `#nullable disable` pragma to every source file in your project.
1. As you work on each file, remove the pragma and address any warnings.
